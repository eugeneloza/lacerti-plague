# Lacerti Plague
An OOP excercise in Unity 3D. Hopefully it'll end up as a Fly Grinder Lite RPG battle system, and very unlikely - as a roguelike RPG Lacerti Plague.

# Game design
The overall idea is to test "items flow" game design concept. The items are not permanent, but are (very) short-living and constantly need to be replentished. There are three types of items in game: normal items (have a very varied durability, often will break after a couple of hits); biological tissues (have high durability and regenerate) and pecularis (have varied durability and usually regenerate over time).

# Story
The player character takes a hot air baloon crouise, which ends up in a crash due to a rogue storm. Washed ashore, he/she finds him/herself as a presumably lone survivor in Patrida Peninsula. Once a home for glorious Archai civilization, now a tropic wasteland, wiped clean by Lacerti Plague, an uncurable lethal disease of unknown origin. Those few intelligent beings met were thrown here as a slow death sentence for their crimes, fighting for the scraps to survive another day. The infection will start with the first scratch.
